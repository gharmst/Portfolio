Project 1: 
I decided to include Floppy Fish, a group assignment from CMPT322 Software Engineering class, for a couple reasons. First, it helps to
meet the CIS program goal of "To provide a background in software development and project management" as it was both of those things -- myself in
a group of three other students had to create a game in Unity and meet deadlines. Next, it also aids in "To understand concepts and processes for
achieving organizational goals with information technology" by providing experience using AGILE development, a methodology likely to be used if
in a software development career. Finally, it helps to "develop an understanding of a basic business environment" in the sense that it provides
experience trying to meet coding deadlines.

Project 2: 
For my second project in my portfolio I decided on the currently barebones ray tracer that I've been developing for CMPT360 Computer Graphics.
In CMPT390 I will use the fully fleshed out ray tracer that will have much more functionality than the current one, which is being written in 
Python. I chose this project for my portfolio again for multiple reasons, the first and biggest reason because it is the hardest project I've
ever had to code in my time so far at Westminster. It also helps to meet a program goal for the Computer Science program -- "To acquire
significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting" obviously just the individual part. In addition to this goal,
I believe it has helped with another in the Computer Science program as well -- "To develop effective problem solving skills" as I have done 
a large amount of problem solving and it's only halfway through the semester so far.
